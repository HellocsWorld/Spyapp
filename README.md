# For the morse code the bullet points are inserted by pushing option and 8 at the same time. also the slashes can be changed to solid line if SMART PUNTUATION is on in the iphone simulator (I had to disable for xcode 10 only)

Morse code Cipher
the morse code cipher has been designed in such a way that does not need a secret keyword and thus any value in the secret part is ingnored. the code is display as in the morse alphabet as follow.

"A": "•-", 
"B": "-•••",
"C": "-•-•", 
"D": "-••",
"E": "•",
"F": "••-•", 
"G": "--•",
"H": "••••",
"I": "••",
"J": "•---", 
"K": "-•-", 
"L": "•-••",
"M": "--",
"N": "-•",
"O": "---",
"P": "•--•",
"Q": "--•-", 
"R": "•-•", 
"S": "•••", 
"T": "-", 
"U": "••-",
"V": "•••-", 
"W": "•--", 
"X": "-••-",
"Y": "-•--",
"Z": "--••",
"1": "•----",
"2": "••---", 
"3": "•••--", 
"4": "••••-", 
"5": "•••••", 
"6": "-••••", 
"7": "--•••", 
"8": "---••", 
"9": "----•", 
"0": "-----", 
".": "•-•-•-",
",": "--••--",
"?": "••--••", 
"'": "•----•",
"!": "-•-•--",
"/": "-••-•", 
" ": "/"

Phone Cypher

The phone code is really cool because not a lot of people know it. 
It is just the number the letter is on and then what number it is on that number. 
For example, A is on the 1st number on 2, so it would be 2 1. 
A=21   
B=22    
C=23    
D=31    
E=32     
F=33    
G=41    
H=42    
I=43    
J=51    
K=52    
L=53   
M=61 
N=62  
O=63   
P=71 
Q=72  
R=73  
S=74  
T=81  
U=82  
V=83  
W=91  
X=92  
Y=93  
Z=94 
SPACE=11
